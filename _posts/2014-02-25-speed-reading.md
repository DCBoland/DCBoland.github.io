title: Speed Reading

The [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/) speed-reading interface caught a lot of attention recently

[Mark McGill](http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/researchstudents/markmcgill/) and I wanted to solve some of the common issues people had with Virtual Reality headsets. We ran a survey, which showed that one of the key issues to address was enabling people to see their keyboard and other people in the room. We stripped down a webcam, mounted it on an Oculus Rift, and tried out a variety of ways of blending the real and virtual worlds. We found blending based on user engagement, such as when users reach for the keyboard, to work best - people actually managed to type fairly well!
