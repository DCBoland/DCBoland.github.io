We ran a survey, which showed that one of the key issues to address was enabling people to see their keyboard and other people in the room. We stripped down a webcam, mounted it on an Oculus Rift, and tried out a variety of ways of blending the real and virtual worlds. We found blending based on user engagement, such as when users reach for the keyboard, to work best - people actually managed to type fairly well! Read the paper.
