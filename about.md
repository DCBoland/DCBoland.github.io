I am a PhD candidate within the University of Glasgow's [IDI group](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/idi/), jointly funded by Bang & Olufsen and the [CoSound](http://www.cosound.dk) project. My research develops quantitative measures for understanding user behaviour with music services. The resulting models of user engagement have informed the design of novel interaction mechanisms for music retrieval, including the (BeoSound Moment)[http://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/sound/sound-systems/beosound-moment] MoodWheel. Side interests include electronics prototyping and virtual reality.
