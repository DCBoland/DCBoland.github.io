title: Engaging with Mobile Music Retrieval
---

This work deals with measuring how engaged a user is in their music retrieval, and how to adapt a retrieval interface to this engagement. It will be presented at mobileHCI in Copenhagen and received a best paper honourable mention. The resulting prototype music system allowed users to navigate music by mood, at a range of engagement levels, and inspired the Bang & Olufsen [BeoSound Moment's MoodWheel](http://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/sound/sound-systems/beosound-moment) interface.

I recruited 95 listeners to provide their last.fm listening histories for analysis and to answer an established music engagement questionnaire {% cite Gre08 %}. This allowed the correlations between music listening behaviour and self-reported music engagement to be explored, resulting in the definition of a set of engagement-stratified listener profiles.

The prototype system shown in the video allows a user to quickly move between levels of engagement, from casual mood selection through to more specific and controlling selection styles. The user can denote their engagement with a pressure sensor {% cite MclBolBre14 %}, using the metaphor of physically engaging with the system.

Paper available from 28th August 2015.
